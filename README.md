# JavaScript-WeatherApp-Project
This is my first ever project done with JS.
As a student still learning JS, thus far with the knowledge gained
I was able to create this impeccable Weather App. 
Yes, I'll be honest YouTube Tutorials did indeed guide me and helped alot, I have no shame in saying that
but hey, even the greatest developers still resort to such platforms to get the job done.
Its all part of the game

I am Proud. Too many more :)
